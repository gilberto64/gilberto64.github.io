For some time now, I had been "nagging" my wife on how I wanted to change things. Specifically  I had been thinking about changing my career. I did study coding/CIS in college, but life took me in a different direction.

Recently, our daughter that lives in Ashville, NC, called my wife and mentioned that she wanted to sign up for coding Bootcamp but given that she is a full time mom with two young kids, she decided against it . She did explain briefly the program to my wife.  Well...5 seconds after they hung up my wife approached me and stated ..."This program is meant for you". Upon reading the website and having a sense of its purpose, I decided to take the plunge.

Change has this way of either you going to it and embracing it or "it" coming to and forcing its way on to you. Joining this program feels to me like I am embracing change.  I do have a "computer" background so I am not totally lost. I do struggle with some of the labs but I have loved some of the lessons. As a side comment, I was particularly impressed with the concept and explanation of Abstraction,  the Picasso "bull tidbit" was dead on point.   So far, nothing has illustrated better to me what is it that we learning here.

Hopefully this change will point me towards the future.
